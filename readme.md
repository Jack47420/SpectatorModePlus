Thanks to owehe1, who maintained the plugin after original creator stopped. Now i will try to maintain and soon upgrade it with new Features:

# Planned Features:
- Multiple Different Modes in config for PVP, Survival and other GameModes.
- Making it possible to watch other players, if they agree.
- Leave your Body behind and be vournable to other players, kicking you out of spectator Mode, for PVP Modes.
  
And more to come!
